        Pakistan is blessed with excellent tourist spots nearly all over the 
        country. Historical places merge into natural sights in a most appealing
         manner. We have historical sights worth at Banbhor, east of Karachi, 
         with its famous museum. Makli in Sindh has the largest necropolis 
         (large graveyard of olden times). Thatta (a district in Sindh) is 
         famous because of Makli. Moenjo-Daro in the Indus river valley, 
         Taxila in the north coast of Rawalpindi, Harappa near Sahiwal, 
         the Lahore Fort, the Badshahi Mosque, Jehangir’s and Nur. Jehan’s
          tombs and the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore are famous historical sights. 
          The Khyber Pass in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, through which conquerors 
          from Afghanistan and Iran entered India, is a natural sight that
           reflects history. Murree, Ayubia, Swat, Kaghan and Naran in the 
           north and Ziarat in Balochistan are fresh and cool like open nature.
            Kalam and its famous Mahudan lake in the north are paradisiacal
             in natural beauty.
